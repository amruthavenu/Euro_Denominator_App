<p class="description">
  This Euro Denomination Calculator App helps you calculate the total value of your cash by breaking down the amount into euro coins and banknotes.  
  Simply enter the amount, and the calculator shows the optimal combination using the fewest bills and coins.  
  You can also compare differences with your previous entry and switch between frontend and backend logic modes.  
  (Coming soon: Option to save your previous data in your browser!)
